*Below is a breakdown I wrote for myself while reading through lopdf. It's raw and not really intended for the general reader, but if you're interested in how lopdf works, you might find it useful.*

---

This document is a breakdown of how [lopdf](https://github.com/J-F-Liu/lopdf) parses PDFs.

All of the data in the PDF is parsed into a `Document` struct:

```rust
/// PDF document.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Document {
    /// The version of the PDF specification to which the file conforms.
    pub version: String,

    /// The trailer gives the location of the cross-reference table and of certain special objects.
    pub trailer: Dictionary,

    /// The cross-reference table contains locations of the indirect objects.
    pub reference_table: Xref,

    /// The objects that make up the document contained in the file.
    pub objects: BTreeMap<ObjectId, Object>,

    /// Current maximum object id within the document.
    pub max_id: u32,

    /// Current maximum object id within Bookmarks.
    pub max_bookmark_id: u32,

    /// The bookmarks in the document. Render at the very end of document after renumbering objects.
    pub bookmarks: Vec<u32>,

    /// used to locate a stored Bookmark so children can be appended to it via its id. Otherwise we
    /// need to do recrusive lookups and returns on the bookmarks internal layout Vec
    pub bookmark_table: HashMap<u32, Bookmark>,
}
```

## PDF Structure

Recall that a PDF has the following structure in the following order (see appendix on [incremental updates](#incrementally-updated-pdfs) for a variation in this structure):

![PDF structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lopdf-breakdown/pdf-structure.png)

- The header contains the version info
- The body contains all of the objects to be rendered
- The `xref` (cross-reference) table contains location information for all of the objects in the PDF and whether or not each should be used
- The trailer, which is the first thing PDF readers are meant to look at. It indicates where to find the `xref` table (via a `startxref` entry), as well as the location of some special objects

## How lopdf works through a PDF

This section describes how lopdf parses a document.

PDF parsing is based around this object:

```rust
pub struct Reader<'a> {
	// PDF input data
    buffer: &'a [u8],
	// The document being created from the parsing process
    document: Document,
}
```

And the primary parsing method which is dissected below:

```rust
fn read(mut self) -> Result<Document> {
	// -- snip --
}
```

Below, the details of the `read` method are described.

### 1. Parsing the version into a `String`

The version is parsed into a `String` by a parser that:

1. Expects `%PDF-` at the beginning of the document
1. Taking until a newline or return is encountered
1. Expects newline and optionally, comments
1. Maps the output into a String with `str::from_utf8`

### 2. Attempting to locate the start of the final `xref` table

Recall that the a PDF will indicate where to find the `xref` table with an entry in the `trailer` like so:

```pdf
startxref
2714
%%EOF
```

In the above example, the `startxref` entry indicates that the `xref` table starts at the 2,714th byte in the document.

lopdf finds the last instance of `startxef` by:

- Setting a cursor near the end of the document (512 bytes from the end, or 0 bytes if the doc is 512 bytes long)
- Looking for the first occurrence of `%%EOF` after the cursor above
- Looking for `startxref`, followed by a number, all within the 25 characters preceding `%%EOF`

If there aren't 25 characters preceding `%%EOF`, or `startxref` and a number isn't found in those preceding characters, or if `%%EOF` isn't found, lopdf returns an error and attempts no further parsing of the document.

ðŸš¨ Potential lopdf bug: If the PDF is [incrementally updated](#incrementally-updated-pdfs) and there are multiple `xref` tables, it seems plausible that going back 512 bytes from the end of the document might not result in taking the final `startxref` entry.

### 3. Parsing the final `xref` table and trailer

Here's an example `xref`:

```pdf
xref
0 11
0000000000 65535 f
0000000019 00000 n
0000000093 00000 n
0000000147 00000 n
0000000222 00000 n
0000000390 00000 n
0000001522 00000 n
0000001690 00000 n
0000002423 00000 n
0000002456 00000 n
0000002574 00000 n
```

As you can see, the `xref` table is not in the same type of format as the rest of the PDF â€“ it isn't composed of [primitives](#pdf-primitives-and-the-object-enum). So it has to be stored in its own data structure, which lopdf parses into using a low-level byte parser like `nom`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Xref {
    /// Entries for indirect object.
    pub entries: BTreeMap<u32, XrefEntry>,

    /// Total number of entries (including free entries), equal to the highest object number plus 1.
    pub size: u32,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum XrefEntry {
    Free,
    Normal { offset: u32, generation: u16 },
    Compressed { container: u32, index: u16 },
}
```

lopdf also implements a number of methods on `Xref` geared around manipulating the `entries` dictionary (adding new entries, removing entries, and so on).

The trailer, on the other hand, is a simple dictionary object:

```pdf
trailer
<<
	/Size 11
	/Root 1 0 R
	/Info 10 0 R
>>
```

...and is parsed into lopdf's [`Dictionary` representation](#dictionary-struct).

### 4. Extending the final `xref` with any preceding `xref`s

Recall that a PDF using the [incremental update](#incrementally-updated-pdfs) pattern will have multiple bodies, `xref`s, and trailers.

lopdf attempts to parse the final `xref` and final trailer first.

If the PDF uses incremental updates, the last trailer in the document will have a reference to the second-to-last trailer, which will reference the third-to-last, and so on.

Previous-trailer references looks like:

```pdf
trailer
<<
	-- snip --
	/Prev 406
>>
```

where `406` is a reference to the byte offset for the previous version's `xref` table.

Using the `Prev` reference to the prior `xref` table, lopdf:

1. Parses the `xref` table and trailer,
2. Appends the new `xref` to the final `xref`.
3. Additionally, if a [`XRefStm`](#xrefstm) entry is present in the trailer, lopdf parses the [cross-reference stream](#cross-reference-stream) pointed by the `XRefSteam` and appends it to the final `xref`.
4. Looks for a `Prev` entry on the previous `xref` table, and if found, repeats this process starting at step 1

By iterating through prior `xref` tables in an incrementally-updated PDF, and adding those entries to the final `xref`, lopdf is able to build up a view of all of the objects in the PDF.

### 5. Comparing the calculated `xref` count vs. max `xref` ID

After it has iterated through all of the previous `xref`s, lopdf then examins the maximum ID key of the final `xref`, and compares it to the number of entries in the final `xref1`. If the two don't match, lopdf issues a warning and manually overwrites the `size` entry on the [`Xref` struct](#xref-and-xrefentry`) to match the max ID.

### 6. Setting some document metadata

After processing the `xref` table(s) and the `xref` count, lopdf sets some document metadata on the [`Document`](#document) instance:

```rust
self.document.version = version;
self.document.max_id = xref.size - 1;
self.document.trailer = trailer;
self.document.reference_table = xref;
```

### 7. Parsing the document objects

Now that lopdf has parsed all of the `xref` entries, it can actually attempt to parse each object in the `xref` and place each object into the [`Document`](#document) instance's `objects` BTree.

lopdf establishes a mutexed vector that can contain all of the parsed [`Object`s](#pdf-primitives-and-the-object-enum):

```rust
let object_streams: Mutex<Vec<(ObjectId, Object)>> = Mutex::new(vec![]);
```

A mutex is needed because the parsing can be done using a parallel iterator, via [`rayon`](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon).

Either sequentially or in parallel,  lopdf iterates over the entries in the final `xref` (which, recall, will contain any entries from the previous `xref`s in the file), and applies a callback, `entries_filter_map`:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "rayon")]
{
    self.document.objects = self
        .document
        .reference_table
        .entries
        .par_iter()
        .filter_map(entries_filter_map)
        .collect();
}
#[cfg(not(feature = "rayon"))]
{
    self.document.objects = self
        .document
        .reference_table
        .entries
        .iter()
        .filter_map(entries_filter_map)
        .collect();
}
```

The callback performs these steps on each [`XrefEntry`](#xref-and-XrefEntry):

1. If the [`XrefEntry`](#xref-and-XrefEntry) is `Free` or `Compressed`, the callback returns early with a `None`
1. Otherwise, the `XrefEntry` is `Normal`, and so the callback parses the [`ObjectId`](#objectid) and [`Object`](#pdf-primitives-and-the-object-reference)
1. If the object has a stream and is of type `ObjStm` then it is an object that contains a stream of other objects, and the callback appends those objects to the `object_streams` mutex vector.
    - If the object has a stream, but is not of type `ObjStm`, and if it is empty, then its `object_id` is appended to a `zero_length_streams` mutexed vector. See below for rationale
1. The `object_id` and the `object` are returned from the callback (although unused since the callback appends to the `object_streams` mutex vector as a side effect)

lopdf then extends the `Document`'s `objects` entry:

```rust
self.document.objects.extend(object_streams.into_inner().unwrap());
```

### 8. Returning the document

Finally, lopdf returns the `Document` from the `Reader`:

```rust
fn read(mut self) -> Result<Document> {
	// -- snip --
	Ok(self.document)
}
```

## Appendix

### Incrementally Updated PDFs

[See this article](https://www.debenu.com/kb/incremental-updates/)

Incremental updates are a pattern PDFs support that essentially appends new PDFs to the existing PDF file. This is a useful pattern because it means that restoring to an older version is as simple as deleting lines from the end of the file.

![Incremental Update]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lopdf-breakdown/incremental-update.png)

### PDF Primitives and the `Object` enum

[See this article](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/developing-with-pdf/9781449327903/ch01.html)

These are the primitives that compose PDF objects

- Null
- Boolean
- Integer
- Real
- Name
- String
- Array
- Dictionary (where the value is any of these primitives, including another Dictionary)
- Stream
- Reference

```rust
/// Basic PDF object types defined in an enum.
#[derive(Clone)]
pub enum Object {
    Null,
    Boolean(bool),
    Integer(i64),
    Real(f64),
    Name(Vec<u8>),
    String(Vec<u8>, StringFormat),
    Array(Vec<Object>),
    Dictionary(Dictionary),
    Stream(Stream),
    Reference(ObjectId),
}
```

### Dictionary struct

The dictionary primitive is represented like so:

```rust
/// Dictionary object.
#[derive(Clone, Default)]
pub struct Dictionary(LinkedHashMap<Vec<u8>, Object>);
```

Where `Object` is the enum of all [primitives](#pdf-primitives-and-the-object-enum).

The dictionary has a number of methods implemented:

- `has()` - indicate whether the dictionary contains a given key
- `get()` - get a given object for a given key (or error if no value found)
- `get_deref()` - get the given object, dereferenced
- `get_mut()` - get an object mutably
- `set()` - insert an object
- `len()` - dictionary length
- `is_empty()` - indicate whether the dictionary's empty
- `remove()` - remove an object from the dictionary (if it's there) and return it
- `type_name()` - get the type of the object

... and so on.

### `XRefStm`

A reference, that may be found in a trailer, pointing to a [cross-reference stream](#cross-reference-stream).

### Cross reference stream

A regular object that can be used to encode the `xref` data that would otherwise be found in an `xref` table.

Example:

```pdf
12 0 obj
	<<
		/Type /XRef
		/Size ...
		/Root ...
	>>
stream
	...stream data containing cross-reference info...
endstream
endobj
```

### Document

```rust
/// PDF document.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Document {
    /// The version of the PDF specification to which the file conforms.
    pub version: String,

    /// The trailer gives the location of the cross-reference table and of certain special objects.
    pub trailer: Dictionary,

    /// The cross-reference table contains locations of the indirect objects.
    pub reference_table: Xref,

    /// The objects that make up the document contained in the file.
    pub objects: BTreeMap<ObjectId, Object>,

    /// Current maximum object id within the document.
    pub max_id: u32,

    /// Current maximum object id within Bookmarks.
    pub max_bookmark_id: u32,

    /// The bookmarks in the document. Render at the very end of document after renumbering objects.
    pub bookmarks: Vec<u32>,

    /// used to locate a stored Bookmark so children can be appended to it via its id. Otherwise we
    /// need to do recrusive lookups and returns on the bookmarks internal layout Vec
    pub bookmark_table: HashMap<u32, Bookmark>,
}
```

### `Xref` and `XrefEntry`

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Xref {
    /// Entries for indirect object.
    pub entries: BTreeMap<u32, XrefEntry>,

    /// Total number of entries (including free entries), equal to the highest object number plus 1.
    pub size: u32,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum XrefEntry {
	Free,
	Normal { offset: u32, generation: u16 },
	Compressed { container: u32, index: u16 },
}
```

### ObjectId

```rust
/// Object identifier consists of two parts: object number and generation number.
pub type ObjectId = (u32, u16);
```
